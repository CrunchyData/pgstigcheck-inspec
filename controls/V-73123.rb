  desc  "Information system auditing capability is critical for accurate forensic
  analysis. Without establishing where events occurred, it is impossible to
  establish, correlate, and investigate the events relating to an incident.
  In order to compile an accurate risk assessment and provide forensic analysis,
  it is essential for security personnel to know where events occurred, such as
  application components, modules, session identifiers, filenames, host names,
  and functionality.
  Associating information about where the event occurred within the application
  provides a means of investigating an attack; recognizing resource utilization
  or capacity thresholds; or identifying an improperly configured application."

  First edit the postgresql.conf file as the database administrator (shown here

  $ sudo su - postgres
  $ vi ${PGDATA?}/postgresql.conf

  Extra parameters can be added to the setting log_line_prefix to log application

  For example:
  log_line_prefix = '<%m %a %u %d %r %p %i %e %s>â€™

  # SYSTEMD SERVER ONLY
  $ sudo systemctl reload postgresql-9.5
  # INITD SERVER ONLY
