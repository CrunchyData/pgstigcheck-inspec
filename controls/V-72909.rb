  title "PostgreSQL must utilize centralized management of the content captured
  in audit records generated by all components of PostgreSQL."
  desc  "Without the ability to centrally manage the content captured in the
  audit records, identification, troubleshooting, and correlation of suspicious
  behavior would be difficult and could lead to a delayed or incomplete analysis
  of an ongoing attack.
  The content captured in audit records must be managed from a central location
  (necessitating automation). Centralized management of audit records and logs
  provides for efficiency in maintenance and management of records, as well as
  the backup and archiving of those records.
  PostgreSQL may write audit records to database tables, to files in the file
  system, to other kinds of local repository, or directly to a centralized log
  management system. Whatever the method used, it must be compatible with
  off-loading the records to the centralized system."
