  desc  "Security flaws with software applications, including database
  management systems, are discovered daily. Vendors are constantly updating and
  patching their products to address newly discovered security vulnerabilities.
  Organizations (including any contractor to the organization) are required to
  promptly install security-relevant software updates (e.g., patches, service
  packs, and hot fixes). Flaws discovered during security assessments, continuous
  monitoring, incident response activities, or information system error handling
  must also be addressed expeditiously.

  Organization-defined time periods for updating security-relevant software
  may vary based on a variety of factors including, for example, the security
  category of the information system or the criticality of the update (i.e.,
  severity of the vulnerability related to the discovered flaw).

  This requirement will apply to software patch management solutions that are
  used to install patches across the enclave and also to applications themselves
  that are not part of that patch management solution. For example, many browsers
  today provide the capability to install their own patch software. Patch
  criticality, as well as system criticality, will vary. Therefore, the tactical
  situations regarding the patch management process will also vary. This means
  that the time period utilized must be a configurable parameter. Time frames for
  application of security-relevant software updates may be dependent upon the
  Information Assurance Vulnerability Management (IAVM) process.

  The application will be configured to check for and install
  security-relevant software updates within an identified time period from the
  availability of the update. The specific time period will be defined by an
  authoritative source (e.g., IAVM, CTOs, DTMs, and STIGs)."
