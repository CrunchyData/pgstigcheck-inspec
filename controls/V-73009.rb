  desc  "Information systems are capable of providing a wide variety of functions
and services. Some of the functions and services, provided by default, may not be
necessary to support essential organizational operations (e.g., key missions,
functions).

It is detrimental for applications to provide, or install by default, functionality
exceeding requirements or mission objectives.

Applications must adhere to the principles of least functionality by providing only
essential capabilities.

PostgreSQLs may spawn additional external processes to execute procedures that are
defined in PostgreSQL but stored in external host files (external procedures). The
spawned process used to execute the external procedure may operate within a
different OS security context than PostgreSQL and provide unauthorized access to the
host system."
