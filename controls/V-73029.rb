  title "PostgreSQL must enforce authorized access to all PKI private keys
stored/utilized by PostgreSQL."
  desc  "The DoD standard for authentication is DoD-approved PKI certificates. PKI
certificate-based authentication is performed by requiring the certificate holder to
cryptographically prove possession of the corresponding private key.

If the private key is stolen, an attacker can use the private key(s) to impersonate
the certificate holder. In cases where PostgreSQL-stored private keys are used to
authenticate PostgreSQL to the systemâ€™s clients, loss of the corresponding private
keys would allow an attacker to successfully perform undetected man-in-the-middle
attacks against PostgreSQL system and its clients.

Both the holder of a digital certificate and the issuing authority must take careful
measures to protect the corresponding private key. Private keys should always be
generated and protected in FIPS 140-2 validated cryptographic modules.

All access to the private key(s) of PostgreSQL must be restricted to authorized and
authenticated users. If unauthorized users have access to one or more of
PostgreSQL's private keys, an attacker could gain access to the key(s) and use them
to impersonate the database on the network or otherwise perform unauthorized
actions."

Now, as the system administrator, restart the server with the new configuration:

# SYSTEMD SERVER ONLY
$ sudo systemctl restartpostgresql-9.5

# INITD SERVER ONLY
$ sudo service postgresql-9.5 restart
