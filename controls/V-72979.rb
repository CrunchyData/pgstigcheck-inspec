  title "PostgreSQL, when utilizing PKI-based authentication, must validate
  certificates by performing RFC 5280-compliant certification path validation."
  desc "The DoD standard for authentication is DoD-approved PKI certificates.
  A certificateâ€™s certification path is the path from the end entity certificate
  to a trusted root certification authority (CA). Certification path validation
  is necessary for a relying party to make an informed decision regarding
  acceptance of an end entity certificate. Certification path validation
  includes checks such as certificate issuer trust, time validity and revocation
  status for each certificate in the certification path. Revocation status
  information for CA and subject certificates in a certification path is
  commonly provided via certificate revocation lists (CRLs) or online
  certificate status protocol (OCSP) responses.
  Database Management Systems that do not validate certificates by performing
  RFC 5280-compliant certification path validation are in danger of accepting
  certificates that are invalid and/or counterfeit. This could allow unauthorized
  access to the database."
