  title "PostgreSQL, when utilizing PKI-based authentication, must validate
  certificates by performing RFC 5280-compliant certification path validation."
  desc  "The DoD standard for authentication is DoD-approved PKI certificates.
  A certificateâ€™s certification path is the path from the end entity certificate
  to a trusted root certification authority (CA). Certification path validation
  is necessary for a relying party to make an informed decision regarding
  acceptance of an end entity certificate. Certification path validation
  includes checks such as certificate issuer trust, time validity and revocation
  status for each certificate in the certification path. Revocation status
  information for CA and subject certificates in a certification path is
  commonly provided via certificate revocation lists (CRLs) or online
  certificate status protocol (OCSP) responses.
  Database Management Systems that do not validate certificates by performing
  RFC 5280-compliant certification path validation are in danger of accepting
  certificates that are invalid and/or counterfeit. This could allow unauthorized
  access to the database."

  To verify that a CRL file exists, as the database administrator (shown here as

  $ sudo su - postgres
  $ psql -c \"SHOW ssl_crl_file\" If this is not set to a CRL file, this is a finding.
  Next verify the existence of the CRL file by checking the directory set in
  postgresql.conf in the ssl_crl_file parameter from above:
  Note: If no directory is specified, then the CRL file should be located in the
  same directory as postgresql.conf (PGDATA).
  If the CRL file does not exist, this is a finding.
  Next, verify that hostssl entries in pg_hba.conf have \"cert\" and
  \"clientcert=1\" enabled:
  $ sudo su - postgres
  $ grep hostssl ${PGDATA?}/pg_hba.conf
